# Pixel Optimal Transport Colocalization 

This repository contains an implementation of the OTC curves on pixel images based on the paper "Colocalization for super-resolution microscopy via optimal transport" by Tameling et al. (2021). 

In addition to the balanced OT case considered in the paper mentioned above, we also provide an extension to the unbalanced (Kantorovich-Rubinstein) case based on the paper "Kantorovich–Rubinstein Distance and Barycenter for Finitely Supported Measures: Foundations and Algorithms" by Heinemann et al. (2023).
